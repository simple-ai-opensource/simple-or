    Concept
    -------
    With the scheduler you can optimize the assignment of tasks to agents.
    Every task takes an amount of time to complete and yields a reward once completed.
    Every agent is characterized by his availability: it can be either available
    in a certain timeslot (1) or not(1).

    The scheduler tries to assign jobs to agents such that it maximizes the reward
    of job execution while respecting the schedule of the agents.

    For example, suppose we have two tasks with a Duration of 2 and 3:

    .. math::
        D = \begin{bmatrix}
            2\\
            3
            \end{bmatrix}

    For now, let's assume that for both tasks we get a Reward of 5 if
    we execute it:

    .. math::
        R = \begin{bmatrix}
            5\\
            5
            \end{bmatrix}

    We also have two agents, which operate in the time interval [1, 2, ..., 5].
    Agent 1 is available during the first two timeslots, agent 2 during the last three.
    Let us denote the agents' Availability by A:

    .. math::
       A = \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1
            \end{bmatrix}

    We can immediately see that the optimal assignment is to assign the start of task 1 to
    agent 1 in timeslot 1, and task 2 to operator 2 in timeslot 3. This may seem
    trivial, but imagine having 1000 tasks and 100 agents!

    Luckily, we can use the ``simpleor.scheduler`` module. You can:

    - import a solver in your own code
    - use the command line to read problem description files and write to a solution file.

Usage
-----
.. dropdown:: Usage Solver

    Import in sourcecode
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You can import the schedule solver as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        from simpleor.scheduler import ScheduleSolverTimeIndex

        schedule_solver = ScheduleSolverTimeIndex(
            task_durations=task_durations,
            available_timeslots=available_timeslots,
            task_rewards=task_rewards
        )


    Since we are now in programming language, we start counting from 0, not 1.
    Calling .solve() on the ScheduleSolverTimeIndex instance will run an Integer Linear
    Programming solver on the problem description.

    .. code-block:: python

        schedule_solver.solve()

    Now we can inspect the solution. The inspection returns a list.
    Each element of the list is an assigned task, with the following fields:
    task_id, agent_id, start_time, stop_time, task_duration

    .. code-block:: python

        schedule_solver.get_solution(kind="native")

        [
            (0, 0, 0, 2, 2),
            (1, 1, 2, 5, 3),
        ]

    You can also use ``kind="dataframe"``, in which case you get back a pandas
    dataframe.

    Command line
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In case you do not want to program in Python, you can use the command line.

    .. code-block::

        $ scheduler --help``

        Usage: schedule [OPTIONS]

          Command Line Interface for scheduler

        Options:
          --durationsfile TEXT  Path to task_durations file
          --schedulefile TEXT   Path to available_schedule file
          --rewardsfile TEXT    Path to task rewards file (optional, default equal reward)
          --read TEXT           What kind of file to read (['csv', 'excel'])
          --solutiondir TEXT    Directory where the solution is written to
          --solutionfile TEXT   Filename of the solution
          --write TEXT          What kind of file to read (['csv', 'excel'])
          -v, --verbose TEXT    Verbosity level ['debug', 'info', 'warning', 'error',
                                'critical']
          --help                Show this message and exit.


    First, you need to create two files.

    - task_durations.csv, which should be a list of the task durations (in one column). The task durations should be integer.
    - available_schedule.csv, where every row corresponds to an agent. A row corresponds to an agent, a column to a period.
      A 1 indicates the agent is available in that timeslot, a 0 means not available.

    Optionally, you can have a task_rewards.csv file specifying the value
    of executing a certain task. If you do not specify this file, the solver
    will assume an equal reward for every task.

    You can store these files anywhere you like. Save the paths to these files
    somewhere.

    Next, open a terminal and type the following command (replace <TASK_DURATION_PATH>
    and <AVAILABLE_SCHEDULE_PATH> with the paths you just stored):

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ schedule --durationsfile <TASK_DURATION_PATH> --schedulefile <AVAILABLE_SCHEDULE_PATH>

    By default, the solution will be stored in the data directory of the package. If you want
    to store it somewhere else, add the following flag: ``--solutiondir <SOLUTION_DIRECTORY_PATH>``

    By default, the name of the solution file is ``solution_cli.csv``. In case you want to
    change it, add the flag ``--solutionfile solution_cli``


    Instead of csv, you can also use excel files. In that case, add the following
    flag: ``--read excel`` or ``--write excel``
